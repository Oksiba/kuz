The provided contexts do not directly address calculating the square of a planet. However, they do provide examples of calculating the square of a number. Based on these examples, here's a Python program that calculates the square of a planet's distance from the sun, assuming the distance is provided in astronomical units (AU):
# Python program to calculate the square of a given number

def calculate_square(number):
    return number ** 2

# Example: Calculate the square of a planet's distance from the sun (in astronomical units)
planet_distance = 1.5  # Example distance of a planet from the sun in AU
planet_distance_squared = calculate_square(planet_distance)

print("The square of the planet's distance from the sun is:", planet_distance_squared, "AU²")

This program defines a function calculate_square that takes a number as input and returns its square. The example then calculates the square of a planet's distance from the sun, assuming the distance is 1.5 AU. The result is printed as "The square of the planet's distance from the sun is: [result] AU²".

Note that this program is not a complete planetary position calculator, as mentioned in [source](https://stjarnhimlen.se/comp/tutorial.html). However, it demonstrates the concept of calculating the square of a number, which can be applied to various programming scenarios.
